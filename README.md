# Y-Cache-Replacement
Trying to insert new cache replacement on YANFD
The code is in golang, but i write it in txt for my own purpose :)
So..The LFU is already worked but the LRFU is still on progress. It actually already working, but i need still to figure it how i modify the weighting function in that LRFU.
